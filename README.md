# lecturesList

This code is for automatically generating a long list of lecture annotations based on data entries in a Google Drive spreadsheet. The displayed lectures can be filtered.

See the [demo](http://kodu.ut.ee/~mihkel84/loengutedemo/).

The code to be copy-pasted into Drupal page entry is in the file UT_lehele.html. Lots of inline css (mostly margins) has to be used for correct formatting.
